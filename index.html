  <p> Welcome to Play of the Day!!! Below are player prop bets for today's games which I think are the best.
    I am not a professional sports gambler, but I like sports and coding. My knowledge is limited so take 
    my advice lightly. I am not responsible for any money lost. I am just trying to have fun and learn.
    Lastly feel free to use the "See Current Record Button" to see how I am doing.
